# Fetch
## Description
Fetch is already available as an experimental feature in Node v17. If you’re interested in trying it out before the main release, you’ll need to first download and upgrade your Node.js version to 17.5.

Alternatively, you can use nvm to update directly from your command line/terminal:

```sh
nvm install 17.5
```
We can now run Fetch-related code by adding the --experimental-fetch parameter with the node command:

```sh
node --experimental-fetch file.js
```
